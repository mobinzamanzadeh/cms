## Technologies Used

- Django: A powerful Python web framework for building web applications.
- Django Rest Framework (DRF): A flexible toolkit for building APIs with Django.
- PostgreSQL: A robust relational database management system.
- dj-rest-auth: A library for handling user authentication and registration in Django Rest Framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up the database configuration in the `settings.py` file.
4. Apply database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
5. Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
6. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`
7. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/`
8. Explore the API endpoints and start building your application!

## API Endpoints

- `/users/`: List all users or create a new user.
- `/users/{username}/`: Retrieve, update, or delete a specific user.

- Implement additional views and serializers to extend the API functionality.
- Customize the permission classes to define your own access control rules.
- Modify the frontend templates or integrate the API with your own frontend application.

## Deployment

1. Set up a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
2. Update the database configuration in the `settings.py` file.
3. Collect the static files: `python manage.py collectstatic`
4. Set up a web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to serve the application.
5. Configure the web server to proxy requests to the Django application.
6. Set up HTTPS for secure communication.
7. Start the web server and access the application.
